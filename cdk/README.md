# Hunter CDK project

This project folder consists of the AWS resources needed by the Hunter app which were written using the AWS CDK and TypeScript with AWS CloudFormation to deploy these resources.

You can find the resources along with their configurations defined in the [cdk-stack.ts](./lib/cdk-stack.ts) file.
