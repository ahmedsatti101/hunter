# Hunter

Hunter is a cross platform app, currently targeting Android and the Web, that allows job seekers to keep track of their job applications. Job seekers will receive a notification 2 weeks after they have submitted an application informing them to chase up their application. If 4 weeks pass by and an application's status is still `Applied`, the job seeker will be informed the application entry status will be changed to `Unsuccessful`.

> The tech stack consists of React Native with Expo, TypeScript and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the backend**

I will be posting updates about the app's journey to v1 and the development process on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-mohamed-566115221/), so keep an eye on that.
